### **Core Features:**

**Dynamic Data Fetching:** The application sources its product data in real-time from the Makeup API, ensuring the information presented is always up-to-date.

**Rich Table Display:** Product attributes such as image, name, category, brand, price, and type are laid out in a clear, tabular format for easy browsing.

**Interactive Rating Visualization:** Product ratings are not merely numeric; they're rendered as progress bars, offering a visual gauge of product popularity and quality.

**Expandable Product Details:** Each table row can be expanded to reveal a spectrum of available product colors, providing comprehensive details without cluttering the initial view.

**Refined Filtering Options:** The inclusion of multi-select dropdowns allows for fine-grained filtering by brand and tags, with the product table updating instantaneously to reflect the selections.

**Column Sorting:** Users can sort products directly from the table header, clicking to toggle between ascending and descending order based on any column criterion.

**Enhanced User Interaction with Modal Windows:** Our application incorporates modal windows that facilitate deeper engagement without leaving the current context. These modals are used primarily for placing orders, allowing users to interact with product options directly from the product table.

**Seamless Purchase Form Integration:** Each product's modal window includes a streamlined purchase form. This form allows users to select product variations, input personal details, and choose delivery options, all within a single, easy-to-navigate interface. The form validation ensures that all necessary information is entered before submission, enhancing the user experience and reducing errors.

### **Technology Stack:**

**React:** The project is built on React, chosen for its declarative UI, efficient update and rendering, and widespread ecosystem.

**Ant Design:** This UI framework supplies a comprehensive suite of design tools and components that underpin the app's user-friendly interface.

**Makeup API:** The live data feed comes from the Makeup API, offering a diverse collection of beauty products and their associated metadata.

### **How to Use:**

The application is designed with intuitiveness in mind. On loading, the user is presented with a sortable table populated with product data. You can search for a product by name, and you can isolate specific subsets of products using brand, tag, type, and tag selectors.
For developers, the project can be cloned from its GitHub repository, and it can be run locally or deployed to a hosting platform of choice.
